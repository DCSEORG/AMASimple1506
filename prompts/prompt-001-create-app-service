create the bicep code needed to deploy an app service instance to azure on alow cost development SKU in UKSOUTH.
create a user assigned managed identity called mid-AppModAssist and assign it to this app service so it can later connect to Azure SQL with this identity 

create asp.net core razor pages app that can connect to an Azure SQL using the user assigned managed identity, the db is:

SERVER = "sql-expense-mgmt-xyz.database.windows.net"
DATABASE = "ExpenseManagementDB"

the app should have a single button to press which runs this code:

INSERT INTO Roles (RoleName, Description) VALUES ('mid-test-1506', 'Mid-level test user with read and write access from 1506 test');

create a zip file for the app code so that it can be deployed to azure in the following manner:

az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group MyRG \
  --name MyWebApp \
  --src-path ./app.zip

Also add the correct terminal command to any deployment scripts you are creating or have created to deploy it.

Make sure app.zip or any .zip files are not excluded by the gitignore file so you can add the app.zip file to the repo for use later in the script

Make sure the app.zip folder unzips to give app folder that has dll file inside it,
do not add another folder level in between like publish folder or other.

make it clear to the user somewhere that the URL to view the app is <app url>/Index so they dont just navigate to the root url
